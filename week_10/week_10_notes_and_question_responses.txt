Clustering:
Based on the dendrogram, it looks like the cells differentiate CFU -> mys -> int -> mid -> unk -> poly. This is aided in knowing that CFU is seen first and poly is seen last. The dendrogram also suggests that poly and unk come from an earlier branching and form independent from the other stages. 

It looked like there were about 7 clusters in the initial heatmap. These were used in the kmeans clustering. The result shows that the stage progression orders in pairs. CFU and mys, int and mid, and unk and poly show similar expression patterns respectively. The kmeans clustering also shows that more genes in bulk are down-regulated and then are changed as differentiation proceeds. 

Differential Expression:
The authors use their statistical software to compare early and late stages of differentiation. They take the ratio of expression level between these two time points and compare the timepoints using a t-test. Significant values are taken as being P < 0.05 and the data are filtered again to only find expression ratios < 0.5 or >2, indicating at least a two-fold change between cell types. For this analysis, I used the first three stages and the last three stages as respective datasets to generate means that could be analyzed with scipy.stat independent t-test. This gave significant p-values for select genes, summarized in the file "significant_genes.txt". It is important to note that given the differentiaion pattern across the cells from the dendrogram, it may be more useful to compare the cell stages in three groups: early, mid and late. The raw data would be more helpful for this, as two mean values are not a large sample size for t-test statistics.

Functional Analysis:
Mir3062 was the most significant hit in the t-test. Ontology results were not available for the dataset achieved. However, looking through the related genes shows many signaling molecules and enzymatic activators. This implies that Mir3062 is somehow acting in gene regulation. Literature on Mir genes shows that they encode miRNAs. miRNAs are shown to regulate gene expression through a variety of mehcanisms. They are typically expressed highly in certain cell stages then nearly ablated in others. The severe ratio in Mir3062 expression pattern suggests that it is regulated in a similar fashion.
