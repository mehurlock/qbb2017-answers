The output from extracting the top 5 quality results produced a file with three of the highest occuring within the mitochondrial DNA. This doesn't say much about their effects, since these results do not report the outcome. As a result, the top_five_extractor.py was modified to produce both the true top five quality as well as the top five excluding mitochondrial DNA. This produces an output which includes the chromosome number joined with the SNP's location on the chromosome as a header. Each header has the mutation general type in addition to what it affects. Most of the mutations occured in upstream, downstream or intergeneic, non-coding regions. These will not significantly affect the gene output for the most part, except for ones that involved protein coding (indicated in the output). One missense mutation occurred on chromosome 8. This will affecet protein coding.
